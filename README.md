<h1>Jarvis</h1>

Jarvis 2.0 is a revamp of our previous project (https://github.com/beckymcclain8/Jarvis).  We used the MERN stack -MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.  We also used Google OAuth for user authentication.

Description: Jarvis 2.0 helps people find lower cost alternatives to hospital procedures in their area.  If theyâ€™re willing to drive further to have their procedure, we can find the lowest cost in a wider area.

Motivation: Health care costs can vary widely between providers with little transparency. Jarvis 2.0 helps to take some of the guesswork out of the cost of major procedures.

Results: We used data from healthdata.gov that outlines costs of procedures in hospitals across the country and present those to members in an easy to understand format.
